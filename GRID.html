	 <h3 id="two">The Origin<h3>
	 <h4>Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer involved with Bitcoin, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications. Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.<br><br>
At the time of public announcement in January 2014, the core Ethereum team was Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson. Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a Swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland GmbH (EthSuisse). Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) was set up as well. Development was funded by an online public crowdsale during Julyâ€“August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, bitcoin. While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.

	 <h3 id="three">The blockchain<h3>
	 <h4>Blockchain is one of the most influentional pieces of technology in from the last decade. The value that blockchain seemingly created out of thin air is now worth 171 Billion Dollars(29/10/2017)<br><br>
		 The thing that is makes it so valuable is that it keeps track of data in a way that is easily verifiable and extremely hard to crack, even when you have a p2p network adding that data. Blockchain's are being used a lot to make currency's, the so called cryptocurrency.<br><br>
		 Right now the cryptocurrency scene is in a bubble, there is lot's of money in it but no actual thing it does. That is for most currency's anyway, Ethereum is a lot more that "just a currency", it's a lifestyle. Also it has lot's of features that would revolutionize computing and data services but who cares about that eyh. omputing and data services but who cares about that eyh.

	 <h3 id="four">Ethereum blockchain<h3>
	 <h4>The Ethereum blockchain is very diffrent from most other blockchain, apart from it being a currency it's also a very efficient data storage(database), and distributed computing service. It has features so you can keep a database something on the blockchain which will be automaticly updated based on a program you wrote.
		After a mayor update which required a hard-fork, Ethereum split up into Ethereum and Ethereum classic, Ethereum classic is still used but not as actively supported as Ethereum.

	 <h3 id="five">The Start<h3>
	 <h4>Ethereum had a goal, which was to make a blockchain platform instead of currency.
	 It started with an ICO, to get enough funding for their idea.<br><br> Ethereum allegedly started because Vitalik<br><br>
